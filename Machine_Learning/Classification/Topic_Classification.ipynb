    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between the last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.    It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the subject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, I would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers, in the following manner:  1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the Challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so.  --or--  2. If you must respond to one of his articles, include within it something similar to the following:      \"Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges.\"  Really, I'm not looking to humiliate anyone here, I just want some honest answers.  You wouldn't think that honesty would be too much to ask from a devout Christian, would you?    Nevermind, that was a rhetorical question.\n",

    "K-Nearest Neighbors doesn't work well for this problem because it does not work well for high dimensional data. The \"curse of dimensionality\" is a way to describe the problem of the size of the data growing exponentially with the number of features/dimensions. K-Nearest Neighbors is especially sensitive to this problem because it requires every point to be close to every axis in the data space. As each feature is added, it becomes harder for two specific points to be close to each other on every single axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Naive Bayes, you set each feature's weight independently, based on how much it correlates with the label. In Logistic Regression, you set all the weights together such that the linear decision function tends to be high for positive classes and low for negative classes. Logistic Regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes does because when you have correlated, repetitive features, Naive Bayes will give both of them strong weights so their influence is double-counted whereas Logistic Regression will compensate by weighting them lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between logistic regression's sum of squared weights vs. C value is that the C value (regularization) avoids learning very large weights by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights. This makes all the weights relatively small. \n"

    "### Part 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several L1 regularization strengths ...<br/>\n",
    "* Produce a Logistic Regression model using the **L1** regularization strength.  Reduce the vocabulary to only those features that have at least one non-zero weight among the four categories.  Produce a new Logistic Regression model using the reduced vocabulary and **L2** regularization strength of 0.5.  Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Show a plot of f1 score vs. log vocabulary size.  Each point corresponds to a specific L1 regularization strength used to reduce the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does performance of the models based on reduced vocabularies compare to that of a model based on the full vocabulary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "* Train on the transformed training data.\n",
    "* Evaluate on the transformed development data.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l1\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L1 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., penalty=\"l2\")` to produce a logistic regression model using L2 regularization.\n",
    "* You can use `LogisticRegression(..., tol=0.015)` to produce a logistic regression model using relaxed gradient descent convergence criteria.  The gradient descent code that trains the logistic regression model sometimes has trouble converging with extreme settings of the C parameter. Relax the convergence criteria by setting tol=.015 (the default is .0001)."

The models based on reduced vocabularies don't do as well although they begin to inch closer to the f1 score of 0.717 at a vocabulary size of 2868 with an f1 score of 0.712. At a vocabulary size of 3705, the f1 score peaks at around 0.730. From there the f1 score dips slightly to around 0.714 and 0.713 with vocabulary sizes of 4925 and 5836 respectively.\n",

    "TfidfVectorizer() returns floats while the CountVectorizer() returns ints. CountVectorizer() returns counts whereas TfidfVectorizer() returns a score of term-frequency times inverse document-frequency\n",
    "In simplistic tf-idf means term-frequency (how often the word appears in the document) times inverse document-frequency (how often the term appears across all documents in the data set). This means words like 'a' and 'the' will have low scores as they are common words. In CountVectorizer(), common words like 'a' and 'the' will have higher weighs because they show up more. \n",
    "\n",
    "The R ratio describes how wrong the model was for a document. The lowest R ratio value you can get is 1, meaning that the predicted label is the same as the correct label. The higher the predicted label probability is, means the lower the probability of the correct probability is (because the sum of the predicted probabilities for all 4 labels must equal 1). In other words, a higher predicted label probability means a stronger confidence in the predicted label. Therefore a high R ratio means a very strong confidence in the predicted label and very little confidence in the correct label.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mistake I see is misspelling. There are several misspelled words in the data set and since tf-idf reward rare words, an issue might be giving a higher weight to mispelled words over the correctly spelled word that is used more often. In order to address this might be breaking the document into sentences rather than words (unigrams) or (bigrams) so that the sentence as a whole provides some context to the document and there is less emphasis put on each individual word.\n",
